# spigot

Spigot implements a very limited subset of Homebrew Cask.

## Installation
```sh
curl -o ~/.local/bin/spigot https://raw.githubusercontent.com/aleksrutins/spigot/main/spigot && chmod +x ~/.local/bin/spigot
```

If you're missing dependencies, it'll tell you when you run it; the only thing you should need to install is `jq`.
